1. Strategic Decisions (Master PRD §14)

ID

Question

Recommended answer

Owner

Decide by

Status

S.1

Product name & brand

Run a naming sprint with 3–5 candidates → trademark + domain check → pick before the marketing site and design-partner outreach (Launch checklist L7).

Founder

Validation gate (Doc 12)

Open

S.2

Launch geography

US first (the research, pricing, carriers and compliance all assume it). Treat any home-market launch as a Phase 4 market pack.

Founder

Validation gate (Doc 12)

Open

S.3

Extensiv migration feasibility (API access, legal)

Desk research (Sept 2026): the API is publicly documented and 3PLs can self-provision keys for external developers, so customer-authorised extraction is a supported workflow. Remaining: legal review of API terms, rate limits, possible connection fees, and rate-card extraction (assume UI export). Confirm all in the Doc 12 test. Fallback: assisted CSV migration.

Tech lead + Founder

Validation gate (Doc 12)

Open

S.4

Billing in MVP: export bridge acceptable?

Yes, the export bridge plus Stripe-billed invoices from the 3PL's accounting tool. Confirm in interviews; if 2+ partners refuse, pull basic invoicing into Sprint 14.

Founder

Validation gate (Doc 12)

Open

S.5

Warehouse hardware standard

Standardise on keyboard-wedge scanners + Zebra-class ZPL printers + a print connector. Confirm per site in the hardware survey (Doc 12 Track C).

Tech lead + Founder

Validation gate (Doc 12)

Open

S.6

Build vs partner (rate shopping, EDI, payments)

Rate shopping: EasyPost or Shippo (decide in Phase 2 · Sprint 9). EDI: Stedi first. Payments: Stripe. Pass provider fees through at cost, shown transparently.

Founder

Validation gate (Doc 12)

Open

S.7

Pricing validation & AI packaging

Test the tiers in the interviews (willingness to pay). Include AI copilot in Growth/Scale. Price autonomous optimisation as an add-on only if measured savings are proven.

Founder

Validation gate (Doc 12)

Open

S.8

Pack-photo retention & privacy

180-day default retention, capture only multi-item/high-value orders by default, private storage, documented privacy notice for workers.

Founder

Validation gate (Doc 12)

Open

S.9

Phase 3 network & marketplace fee model

Decide in Phase 3: per-order network fee + marketplace success fee; free listings.

Founder

Phase 3 planning

Open

S.10

HIPAA / health data stance

Prohibit PHI in Phases 1–2 via the terms of service. Revisit only if a healthcare 3PL design partner needs it (then BAAs with us and our sub-processors, plus extra controls).

Founder

Validation gate (Doc 12)

Open

S.11

Public 3PL directory earlier (Phase 2 lite) or Phase 3 only?

Keep the public directory in Phase 3 by default. Launch a lightweight directory (profiles + proximity search, no RFP matching) in Phase 2 only if marketing wants early SEO/brand acquisition and at least 10 3PLs are live to list.

Founder

Phase 2 planning

Open

S.12

AI crawler policy for public pages (allow training crawlers or search-only?)

Allow search/answer crawlers and AI training crawlers on public marketing, docs and directory pages (the goal is to be known and recommended); block all bots from the app, floor, portal, internal and API paths. Review yearly.
